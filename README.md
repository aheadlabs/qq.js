# qq.js
Some Javascript automation for everyday developing.

With qq.js you can automate custom routines in your websites at execution time for every route/URL. It has been conceived in a ASP.NET MVC 5 environment, but is not restricted to this platform. Please, comment your experience if you use it in this or any other environment.

Right now you can:
* Populate forms fields automatically for debugging purposes, with static data (we would like to make it dynamic in future versions).
* Apply a filter to form fields names for population (for testing forms partially)
* Make callbacks, personalized for every route/URL.
